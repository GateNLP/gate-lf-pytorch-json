# ds = Dataset(metafile)
# wrapper = ModelWrapperSimple(ds) # or some other subclass
# wrapper.train()
# # get some data for application some where
# instances = get_them()
# preditions = wrapper.apply(instances)
# NOTE: maybe use the same naming conventions as scikit learn here!!

    # is set to None
    # Also, by default, the method should decide which format
    # to use for reading the data (original or converted)
